		<img src="BACKIMAGE3.jpg">
		<p>In 2010, we started selling local clothes. Actually my wife likes selling clothes and accessories for girls only. Then I told her after a few weeks that selling skateboard products was very popular in Angeles. I then approaced my friend from Bulacan who owned his own skateshop which is one of the respected shop in the Philippines. Then we started saving money so that we can get by until we started to import our products from USA</p>
